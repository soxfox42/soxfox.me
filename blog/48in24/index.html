        Last year, <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a> announced a
        challenge called #12in23. Each month, they would feature certain
        languages alongside a few interesting exercises in an attempt to
        encourage users to learn 12 programming languages in the year.
      </p>

      <p>
        This year, they announced
        <a href="https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24">#48in24</a>. No, they
        didn't expect everyone to suddenly learn 4 times as many languages - the
        site only has 67 languages (as of the last time I updated this page), so
        you'd have to cover 70% of their content! Instead, each week, beginning
        from mid-January, they feature a new exercise, along with 3 languages to
        try it in.
      </p>

      <p>
        I really enjoyed #12in23, and completed all of the featured exercises,
        earning myself a shiny virtual badge! But reading through some of the
        discussions on the
        <a href="https://exercism.org/r/discord">Exercism Discord server</a>, I
        felt like I should have taken more time to reflect on the languages,
        instead of just blasting through them.
      </p>

      <p>
        So that's what I'll be doing on this blog! Each week, once I've
        completed the exercise in 3 languages, I'll reflect on it here. For some
        tasks, I will have already completed it in a featured language, which
        means I get to choose another language to reach the goal of 3 per task
        in 2024.
